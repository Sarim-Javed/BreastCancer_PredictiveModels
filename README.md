# BreastCancer_Prediction
This repository contains a project focused on predicting breast cancer using various machine learning algorithms. The primary objective is to develop and evaluate predictive models that can assist in the early detection and diagnosis of breast cancer. The following machine learning techniques are explored in this project:

 **1-Logistic Regression**
 **2-Decision Tree**
**3-Random Forest**
# Contents
**Data:** Includes the dataset used for training and testing the models. The dataset contains features relevant to breast cancer diagnosis.
**Preprocessing:** Scripts and notebooks for data cleaning, feature selection, and preprocessing steps to prepare the data for modeling.
**Models:** Implementation of logistic regression, decision tree, and random forest models.
**Evaluation:** Performance metrics and evaluation scripts to assess the accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score of each model.
**Visualizations:** Notebooks and scripts to generate visualizations that help in understanding the model performances and feature importances.
**Documentation:** Detailed documentation of the methodology, experiments, and findings.
